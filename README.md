Do you adhere to code standards in your chosen programming language?
Yes

Are you familiar with object orientated programming?
Yes, although with Swift Apple has moved to protocol orientated programming. 
From what I have seen so far it does seem to be an improvement and I’m excited to be working on this new paradigm

Most interesting/complicated project worked upon? How large was it?
The most interesting project for me is one that I started in the last 6 months or so. It’s a mobile strategy game. 
I find it interesting because it has allowed me to get my hands dirty with graph search and will hopefully start to use other AI features soon, 
time depending. This is one area where I have the passion to do extra programming in the evening or on weekends.
It’s a reasonable size with over 60 classes (a number are just different game objects) for a personal project as is growing.

Familiarity with version control? Git?
I’m most familiar with SourceTree and Bitbucket having used this exclusively with my commercial experience.


What does your work environment look like? What tools do you use for development/debugging? How about build systems (Gulp, Grunt, etc)?
Xcode for IOS and Android Studio with Android. A very small bit of experience with Gradle for Java


Rate how comfortable/experienced you are in the following areas
HTML - Small amount of knowledge
Python - Just started learning
App development (Android/iPhone/React Native) - Most comfortable with native IOS and almost as much with native Android app development. 
Other backend languages (Ruby/Java/etc) - I have a small amount of experience with server side Java. It would take only a small amount of training to improve it to the level of a junior backend programmer.

Solve the following program using a language of your choice (Can even do it in pseudocode), 
Although, the majority of my experience has been with Obj-C I decided to do the project in Swift 3 which I have just recently started learning. 
As Apple says that Swift is the future. I believe that any new projects should really be started in Swift unless there is a strong reason not to. 
Naturally, Obj-C will remain important for some time given the number of legacy projects using Obj-C but Apple is likely to stop supporting it sooner rather than later given past indications. 
Therefore, many projects are already in the process of migrating over to Swift or ‘Swifting'.
